Final Project - Context-Free Language System for Matrix Operations
For Class: CS4TB3 (Taught By Prof. Eden Burton)


Functionality:
The system expects an input text file which contains matrix definitions and operations that can be interpreted as sentences of a specific context-free language (detailed below).
The system will then execute the instructions given on the specific matrices and store the results as directed.
Matrices can contain integers or decimals (but a leading number must be included ex ".4" will not be recognized by the system)


//name of language is MAT (matrix-arithmetic-terminology)
Formal Definition of Context-free Language:

    program             :=  matrixDeclaration+
                            operationStatement*
                            outputStatement+ EOF

    matrixDeclaration   :=  MATRIX IDENTIFIER OPENBRACKET INTEGER CLOSEBRACKET
                            OPENBRACE
                                (OPENBRACE csvLine CLOSEBRACE)+
                            CLOSEBRACE BREAK
    csvLine             :=  number (COMMA number)*
    number              := (MINUS)? (INTEGER | FLOAT)

    operationStatement:
    //incomplete for now, but something like IDENTIFER EQUALS functionStatement
    //and functionStatement can be one of these:
        {between 2 matrices}
        dot-product
        cross-product
        add
        subtract

        {for a single matrix and a scalar number (positive/negative)}
        scalar multiplication
        elementWise Addition
        elementWise Subtraction

        {for a single matrix}
        isSquare
        transpose
        inverse
        determinant

    outputStatment      := EXPORT IDENTIFIER (COMMA IDENTIFER)*
                            ( SEPARATELY | AS IDENTIFIER )
                           BREAK

    MATRIX              := '$'
    IDENTIFIER          := [A-Za-z_]+
    MINUS               := '-'
    INTEGER             := [0-9]+
    FLOAT               := [0-9]+'.'[0-9]+
    COMMA               := ','
    OPENBRACE           := '{'
    CLOSEBRACE          := '}'
    BREAK               := ';'
    EXPORT              := 'export'|'EXPORT'
    SEPARATELY          := 'separately'|'SEPARATELY'
    AS                  := '>>>'
